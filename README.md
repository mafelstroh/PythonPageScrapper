# Python basic Page Scraping :rocket:

### Powered by [![Python 2.7.1](https://www.python.org/static/favicon.ico)](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

This is a basic exercise to demonstrate Python's capabilities to scrap easily websites, *without* using known external libraries such as [Beatiful Soup](http://web.stanford.edu/~zlotnick/TextAsData/Web_Scraping_with_Beautiful_Soup.html)

### Used technologies
- Python 2.7.12

### Used native libraries

- **urllib2** *for making requests to external website*
- **re** *for regular expressions*
- **collections** To make some operations easier using Python's stack of tools.
